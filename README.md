Sample Databricks App that enables users to review table and column descriptions stored in a data dictionary table within the target schema.  The data dictionary table should be named 'data_dict', and it should have the following columns: name (name of the table or column as present in Unity Catalog), type (table, column), parent (the name of the parent table or schema), description(the description for the table or the column).  Information from this data dictionary can then be used to bulk load the metadata into Unity Catalog at whatever interval is prefered.
